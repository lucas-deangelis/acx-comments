It's still an improvement,  it just didn't solve the problem all the way. :)\n\nLooking at the source code, the problem is that the links point to anchors that don't exist.  So e.g., footnote 2 links to an anchor \"fn:replant\", and the link back from footnote 2 links to an an anchor \"fnref:replant\", but there are no such anchors, so they don't work.  So, if you want this to work, you'll have to add the appropriate anchors.  So e.g., the footnote 2 link should, in addition to href=\"...\", also have name=\"fnref:replant\".  And at the beginning of foonote 2 there should be an 'a' tag with name=\"fn:replant\".\n\nI do notice you changed the anchor links from absolute on slatestarcodex.com, to absolute on the correct page; that will work, once you add the names, but I would still encourage you to use relative anchor links as described above -- where you only include the anchor (including the number sign), not the rest of the URL -- so that they will still work if this is posted elsewhere, as general good practice.",

Generate the HTML (simple, has only basic tags, no reliance on CSS)\n2. Open in browser, Ctrl+A, copy (I said copy-paste above, I meant copy)\n3. Paste in substack\n\nSubstack seems to ingest it just fine, recognizes tags like <blockquote>, seems to handle our images pretty well, etc. \n\nSo if anyone submitted book reviews to you in a plain-jane HTML format, my advice is to copy it from a browser and paste THAT directly into substack and see how it looks; if they're not relying on any weird CSS and it's just structured text with basic tags chances are it should work. If it has simply formatted anchor tags for footnotes, in theory those should work too!",

As such, #1 is a *much* weaker claim than #2 for this particular policy in the long term (#2 would require that on average people are happier on a vegan+bug diet; #1 would require only that they're on average at least ~half as happy).\n\n#1 was the easy out that I actually agree with. #2 and #3 are more dubious, and #4... well, see my actual reply.\n\nDon't worry about the typo; it happens.",

You can't do that for #4, because the individual people are different; the claim would have no meaning. So I interpreted all of the scenarios as \"a set of people in the normal-food-production universe, versus the same set of people in the bugs-and-trees-only universe\". And in that framing, you can't distinguish between total happiness and average happiness, because the population is constant. (It's not even that the population size is constant -- the population, down to each individual, is constant.)\n\nMore to the merits of your point, we are not close to current carrying capacity now, so it isn't immediately obvious that increasing capacity would increase the population, but it's not an unreasonable assumption either.",

Of these 38 million acres, approximately half are owned by the federal government. California’s rangelands are classified as Mediterranean, desert, and intermountain, and are among the most productive in the West. California’s predominant range type is Mediterranean annual rangelands, which encompass all of the Central Valley, as well as the coastal and foothill ranges. Annual forage production in these regions is seasonal, but grazing of green or dry forage occurs year round. The Mediterranean grasslands of the North Coast, because of the region’s moderate climate and increased rainfall, produce forage for a longer period.\n\nThe state’s desert rangelands are located primarily in the southeastern region of California. A mixture of annual vegetation, perennial grasses and shrubs provide forage for domestic livestock and many species of wildlife. Winter and spring rains support annual plant growth; however, rainfall can be erratic and shrubs provide feed for livestock during dryer periods. Intermountain rangelands are located in the northern and eastern regions of the state. Winter dormancy and spring-summer growth dictate livestock management systems vastly different than in other regions of the state.\n\nCattle typically graze lower elevation forage in the spring, and are then moved to higher elevation pastures during the summer months. Ranchers in the intermountain areas generally harvest and store forage during the summer for winter feeding. During the fall, cattle may graze crop residue, residual rangeland, or pasture forage. Cattle may be fed hay or transported out of the region during the winter months.\"\n\nMoving cattle is transhumance, which farmers everywhere do; it was called \"booleying\" in Ireland  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundale  and you can still see it today with sheep farming, where the sheep are brought down from the hills to the sea-level pastures for the grass growing period in Spring (and lambing season).\n\n(2) https://www.morningagclips.com/sustaining-the-tradition-of-ranching-in-california/  There's a change from raising cattle to market gardening:\n\n\"However, since 1984, California has lost 1.5 million acres of irrigated agriculture and rangeland, said summit presenter Keali’I Bright, assistant director of the California Department of Conservation. Between 2014 and 2016, 130,000 acres of grazing lands were converted to orchards or vineyards.\n\n“Why are lands changing?” Bright asked. “The population is increasing, and, driven by cost of living, there’s a drastically changing commute tolerance and different transportation options.”",

It seems like a noble savage stereotype targeted at rural communities translated into a hypothesis.\n\nI've experienced more than a few of these close knit, traditional societies, both in the US and outside of it. Perhaps more importantly, I was in one of them as an insider and another as a quasi-insider. These communities were certainly orderly but because the enforcers of that order were private they in turn could use that authority for personal projects. A completely social society is a society without objective standards, which in turn means everything is a matter of social dominance. This might sound horrible but the advantage is that there is no dispassionate enforcement. If the law says X, and X is monstrous, you can at least be sure there's no bureaucrat paperclip maximizing X. The private enforcer will realize this is stupid and stop. And no one gossips, \"Look at Scott, he stopped maximizing paperclips!\"\n\nBut make no mistake. These societies can be very cruel. They can also be very kind. But they don't necessarily have to be. For example, a bunch of Southern plantation owners instead would also use this kind of enforcement and not to good ends. Lynching was violence aimed at social control very famously. This is without getting into problems inherent the system, like how they have forces inherently pushing them towards insularity, conformity, and (often hereditary) hierarchy.\n\nThese kind of rural, neighborly societies solve many problems caused by deracinated urban life. You'll never feel alone, or out of place, or like you don't have a purpose or place in life. But they have other issues.",

Let's say there is a lot that goes on beneath the surface, you can't google it, but everyone knows it. \n\nIt can be good or bad. It can be why conflicts can be resolved without resort to lawyers or violence, it can be kind, it can be genuinely merciful, it is the basis of small-town morality (because everyone not only knows everyone else, everyone knows everything about everyone else, so you will get a reputation and it does matter). In a little town not far from where I live, it is what burned some white supremacist jackass's church building flat to the ground, before he even had a chance to open it, and none of the locals ever saw a thing.\n\nIt also is why outsiders and newcomers are not trusted, until they prove themselves. Or why JoeBob's Aggregate ever always only wins all the bids to do the road work in the county, year after year (because Commissioner BillyBob is porking JoeBob's wife, three times nightly). It can be why the no-account kid of some asshole member of the local gentry can tear around his pickup night after night, drunk as a lord, and the local cops pretend not to notice or take the kid back home rather than teach him a richly deserved lesson. It can be the very real threat of violence against anyone who speaks up or who gets out of line and the local notables don't appreciate the competition.\n\nNot only all that, but to paraphrase Karl Marx, this type of social arrangement reflects a certain type of economic situation and, to the extent it works, it works only in that specific situation. As I alluded in an earlier post - it doesn't work in the big city where nobody knows anyone.",

Irish Travellers are *not* Roma or English Gypsies, let's establish that at the start.  There are names that are clan names, such as the one mentioned in the case above - Ward.  McDonagh would be another one, as would Connors.  Accent would be another signifier - Travellers do tend to have a slightly different but noticeable accent from settled people.  Anything more is going to veer dangerously into \"that's racism/prejudice\" territory.\n\nThere's a *very* Politically Incorrect comedy sketch from several years back about Travellers which touches on all the stereotypes (including the liberal TV show presenter who comes down to spend time amongst the quaint people and make a documentary about their lives with a very patronising tone).  Watch at your peril!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOY5bW0JVY\n\nThe joke about \"I'm Pa Connors named after my father and he's Pa Connors named after his grandfather\" is based on reality because there are family names where you can have brothers and cousins all named, for example, Patrick McDonagh.  The musical joke is that the air they're playing is called \"Banish Misfortune\" and they play the same tune over and over but call it different names.",

Lynching was violence aimed at social control very famously.\n\nI'll note that neither of these examples seems to contradict the hypothesis, violating both the \"close-knit\" and \"workaday affairs\" clauses. That is, I assume slaves weren't in a close-knit group with their masters, and lynch victims typically weren't in one with their killers, and anyway the hypothesis excludes situations where someone can be killed with impunity.\n\nThat said, I think you make a good point. One could reply \"it's a descriptive hypothesis, not a normative one; if we don't like the outcomes, that doesn't mean the hypothesis is false\". But I think that would be a cheap shot, because the enforcement mechanisms themselves might harm welfare. Like, if someone generally prefers living under the shadow of a dispassionate legal system, to living under the shadow of gossip and personal retribution, then... that doesn't necessarily show up in the welfare function, but if enough people feel that way it might do?",

    "body": "I was astonished reading this that no consideration was given to the cost or reliability of turning to the legal system.  There seems to be an underlying assumption by some legal economists that laws provide smooth and frictionless incentive structures.  Litigation is expensive, mentally and emotionally taxing, can drag on for years, and can be uncertain in outcome.  Lawyers are expensive and the legal system is extremely hostile to non-specialists.  Invoking the legal system in many disputes could be viewed as a form of altruistic punishment - choosing the lose-lose option in order to deter future transgressors.  In this case, the legal system would be best reserved for extreme edge cases – financially ruinous breaches of contract, life ruining torts, or reliably and investigating and prosecuting extreme examples of criminal self help (murder, assault).",

The duel (or rather the threat of injury or death in one) is often a form of norm enforcement that flourishes when recourse to formalized legal recourse is unavailable.\n\nThus, for example, a very prevalent and widely accepted cause of duels clear up to the end of the 19th century was incidents in which the challenged party was thought to have cheated at cards or other gambling games.  More generally, betrayals outside the perceived scope of the law tended to trigger challenges that were socially supported.\n\nTwo factors that decreased the incidence of dueling were (a) increasing availability of justice through a court system and (b) increasing lethality of personal weapons. One significant transition point was reached in the 1840s when the sealed percussion cap greatly reduced the odds of a misfire or squib in damp European weather. The sword duel actually outlasted the pistol duel; the last recognizable formal sword duel was actually fought in 1967 in Paris!",

States will be proportioned to hold as close as possible the an equal number of counties.'\n\nOther than the absurdly high number of  counties in dense cities (some buildings in New York or other dense urban core might have multiple counties, by floor perhaps?) and weird relationships for utilities (a thousand counties need to band together to pay for the sewer system for example), I wonder what would happen to governance if we limited the #'s to human understandable human walkable?\n\nI suspect a lot of people would be really mad, because they would have to participate in governance and politics... I think many people (more urban than rural) are governmental free riders who enjoy nor having to worry about governance and such unless something triggers them for their cause du jour.\n\nI suspect politics would be radically different (better?) when limited to human-understandable groups you could have actual human relationships with - the monthly 'County 101' dinner where all 150 voters get together for a meal and a conversation would be very different than the politics of today. \n\nMany things would work better, and many things would be harder/worse.

    "body": "Ah yes, slime molds. As per usual with claims of solving NP-hard problems, the issue is that they are solving a slightly different problem than claimed.\n\nLet's look at what they are actually solving for a moment. (Note: I'm using equality in the below in an arguably incorrect manner. Heads up.)\n\nFirst, note that a slime mold (and indeed, any physics-based solution for pretty much any problem) has a finite maximum resolution. (You might argue what exactly said resolution is, but ultimately you can agree hopefully that there exists some floor here.)\n\nSecond, note that a slime mold has Θ(area) computational power (at least in theory. Biological constraints may reduce this).\n\nThird, note that a slime mold has a finite maximum speed of information propagation (trivial bound: speed of light; practical bound - I don't know the actual figure but probably substantially less than the speed of sound). And hence requires O(max distance) time to compute a result. (Be it exact or α-approximation - if you require less than O(max distance) time, consider two points at (-L, 0) and (L, 0), and a third point at choice[(0, L/sqrt(3)), (0, -L/sqrt(3))], with L chosen to be large enough that the third point cannot communicate with the others before time is up. Without communication, you are forced to pick some common point for the Steiner node - but no matter what point you pick there's an adversarial choice where you are incorrect. Your best bet is to pick (0,0), but this results in a distance of (2 + 1/sqrt(3))L. Given that the optimal tree for both has a distance of 2L, this means you cannot approximate better than a factor of 1/(2 sqrt(3))... which is required for both exact solutions and α-approximation.)\n\nAnd finally, note that the slime mold is not solving the problem exactly - assuming it is solving this particular problem exactly, it is solving the original problem within an error of... let's see.\n\nLet's treat things as a grid, and work in distance units of our resolution. We have n nodes. Scale the problem such that the maximum dimension of the resulting problem is `s`. With this solution, we're moving every Steiner node by up to a half of a unit distance from the optimal tree; an optimal Steiner tree has at most n-1 nodes (and hence at most 2n-1 edges), so the cost changes by at most 0.5*(2n-1)=n-0.5 units. The optimal tree trivially has a distance of at least o(s). So overall our factor of error is (n-0.5)/o(s), or O(n/s).\n\nMeanwhile, to get said factor of error we had O(s^2) area of slime mold computing for at a minimum of O(s) time [in general; obviously if a problem is restricted e.g. entirely 1d this does not happen]. Or O(s^3) total computational steps. \n\nAll told this works out to O(n^3 ε^-3) complexity. (...ish. I don't know how much of the slime mold is actually active during this entire time.)\n\nNow, how does this compare to standard algorithms?\n\nSteiner trees are NP-hard, yes, but Euclidean Steiner trees have α-approximation schemes for constant dimension (that is, for any given desired `ε>0`, you can construct a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to produce a result that is no more than `1+ε` times the optimal result).\n\nThe best I could find at a quick glance was O(n (log n + ε^(-C/ε))). You'll note that this is substantially better than the slime mold for large n.\n\n(Interesting, the α-approximation schemes for Euclidean Steiner trees are also largely based around discretizing to a grid first - but they can form a finer grid because they don't spend anywhere near O(s^3) steps on the resulting grid.)\n\nOr to put it another way: I'm not sure if we _care_ what the slime molds are doing, because we can already do better by simply exploring the entire area, sending back information about any nodes to a central spot, and doing the calculation there. (Well, we may care. But not for this particular reason.)",

For example, “fair-use doctrine is quite restrictive unless they get explicit permission,” can be read as suggesting that the fair use determination depends in some way on asking for permission. But the whole point of fair use is that it doesn’t require permission.\n\nWhat’s really going on here, which the author gets at by referring to professors “avoiding learning the details of fair use doctrine,” is that professors almost universally believe that their photocopying is fair use. Making multiple copies for classroom use is one of the illustrative fair purposes in the statute. Professors rely on that fact and tend either not to know that it’s not conclusive or to assume that even if you do the rest of the analysis, it will obviously cash out in favor of fair use.",

Defending reputations with violence seems to be a natural human thing. You can sue for defamation today, which makes the threat of violence more abstract, more impartial, and hopefully removes the necessity for violence at all. But if someone disobeys a court order, the state can use violence to enforce it. On the other end of the scale, compare dueling to unregulated reputation-maintenance violence. Closest thing you might see in modern society is a brawl among gang members, who don't have effective access to the courts to solve defamation issues. This violence is usually, but not always, less extreme (usually fists, not guns), but also does not offer as many off-ramps. A spur of the moment apology might prevent violence or it might not. You may or may not have an opportunity to apologize. It might be your innocent kid who ends up dead from a drive by shooting instead of you.

    "body": "re: academia my sense was always that this was a kind of unofficial PR/advertising interest in publishers refraining from making a big stink.  Indeed, since professors often decide what books whole classes use (often with much better profit margins than the academic books profs use) and are the ones often providing the content it would be idiotic for any publisher with an interest in having their books choosen to make a fuss about this.  They also know that (more so pre-digital but scans are still inferior) established profs with the money to spare will probably buy copies of the books but while the grad students who lack the cash will favor the copies but, if they find the book appealing, will likely buy a copy at some point in their career.\n\nIt's more that the overhead of trying to do this via a formal legal process wouldn't be workable.  For one, if an official copy lacks features (search) or has bad quality the publisher gets blamed and any rule they tried to articulate would run the risk of being abused at scale.\n\nThis isn't to say that it's not the kind of system held together by informal norms but that the publishers are part of this informal norm system.",

    "body": "Keep in mind that ranches are big and require a long-term investment. Cattle ranching requires lots of land, and while a herd can be moved, but the land cannot. Not only that, but thanks to surveys, land law and easements, it is usually pretty clear who holds title to a given parcel of land at any given time, and who is permitted to enter on which parcel of land and for what purpose. \n\nFurther, because ranches are big long-term enterprises, there can only be so many ranches and ranchers in a given area, and it is likely that all the ranchers know one another. Their families probably all go way back. Moreover, all the ranchers will need favors or forbearances from one another from time to time (not necessarily business related), so it is best not to make long-term enemies.\n\nTherefore, law or no law, the ranchers either have to get rid of each other (whether by violence or buyout), or they have to learn to live with one another. Wild West Game of Thrones aside, violence ends badly in the long-term for most participants, and even at best is unpredictable, especially in the age of firearms. Buyout is expensive. Learning to tolerate each other is probably the least-cost solution, not to mention the one least likely to attract heat from bankers, banditti, lawyers, and law enforcement. \n\nIn a similar vein to ranchers, dorm room anarchists assume that \"primitive\" tribes have no laws. In fact, such tribes typically have laws, in the sense that they have codes, often quite convoluted, governing who is allowed to marry whom, who is permitted to eat what and with whom, who is in the right in a particular type of dispute, who answers for the conduct of whom, etc.. Just that these codes are not written down or lawyered over. \n\nMargaret Mead aside, a lot of these codes pertain to sex and family, probably because arguments over who is permitted to sleep with whom, over \"is that really my kid?\", over which kid is entitled to what, are the fastest way to tear a tribe apart or simply to lead to unnecessary intra-tribal conflict. And outside the tribe, you may be fair game for anyone. This is why tribes are so tribal. in the sense that it's \"us against them\" and at the same time, why tribal norms are so relentlessly enforced. They have to be.\n\nFor instance, in spite of his wartime prowess, Crazy Horse lost his status as Shirt Wearer in the Oglala Sioux, because he had an affair with a married woman. If he had abducted a woman from an enemy tribe, the outcome probably would have been different.\n\nAs to whether such a not-quite-anarchy solution works in other environments, one in which the participants are not incentivized to at least learn to tolerate one another - well, that is probably why city dwelling businessmen are much more litigious than ranchers or tribesmen, and city drug gangs are rumored at times to resort to even less cooperative solutions.",

My actions (norm-violating, norm-enforcing, whatever) are going to be seen by others as more or less reasonable, and that will affect my reputation and my interactions with them.  At the extreme unreasonableness end, it will even lead others to punish me for my norm violations.  I think that's the driver for a tendency to maximize welfare (visible well-being).  \n\nWhen the healthy guy doesn't shovel his walk because he can't be arsed, everyone knows he's just being a lazy bum.  When the 70 year old widow who uses a cane to walk doesn't shovel her walk, nobody thinks she's violating any norms.  (And indeed, it's quite likely that some neighborhood kid or other will just go ahead and shovel her walk while he's shoveling his own, in my neighborhood.)  This works well because it's visible.  If the apparently healthy guy actually has some kind of back problem and shoveling the walk will leave him incapacitated for the next week, he'll probably get a lot of unjust pushback from the neighbors, because it sure *looks* like he could do it.  \n\nIf I yell at the little old lady for not shoveling her walk, everyone is going to think I'm a jerk.  If I yell at the apparently-healthy guy for not shoveling his walk, everyone is going to think I've got a point.

    "body": "\"Ellickson mentions a tribe where they “cut a finger from the hand of each of a man’s close female relatives after he dies”; what medical knowledge are they lacking that makes this seem welfare-maximizing?\"\n\nDid he give no further detail on what tribe this is from where, or are you leaving it out?  An initial notion that comes to mind is the fear of witchcraft, so by social sanctions such as this you are trying to prevent bad outcomes - a potential witch wanting to curse someone to death has to bear in mind the loss of a finger, and other female family members who are at risk will try to prevent the witch from doing anything.  Substitute \"poison or otherwise encompass the murder of an abusive male\" and the same applies.  But not knowing the social and cultural background leaves a lot of information out - what is the position of unmarried daughters/sisters, of widows and mothers, when it comes to \"close female family members\"?   Is this about sacrificing for the benefit of the deceased man in the afterlife - the custom of sati was religiously sanctioned in Hinduism as examples of chaste wives who would benefit their families and the souls of their husbands by virtue of their sacrifice, as well as widows being considered inauspicious and capable of bringing misfortune to others.  There may be a lot of reasons for such a practice and I'd like to know more about the tribe in question.\n\nWhich brings us on to the naive belief in Science and Progress doing away with the Darkness of Superstition, and quite frankly I'm surprised that even a book from the 80s would be holding on to that kind of hopefulness:\n\n“A tribe that used to turn to rain dancing during droughts thus is predicted to phase out that ritual after tribe members learn more meteorology. Tribes are predicted to abandon dangerous puberty rites after members obtain better medical information. As tribe members become more familiar with science in general, the status of their magicians and witch doctors should fall. As a more contemporary example, faith in astrology should correlate negatively with knowledge of astronomy. These propositions are potentially falsifiable.”\n\nA tribe that knows to tune in to the nightly weather forecast on the TV news may still engage in rain dances as a matter of cultural heritage, and because it's fun to dress up and have dances as a social activity.  Magicians and witch doctors will still have places as sources of traditional wisdom and advice on matters that \"take two aspirin and call me in the morning\" can't address - how do I propitiate my mother-in-law's ghost because my marriage is going badly and she always threatened to come back and haunt us because she never liked me?  'Dangerous puberty rites' may be tidied up by having trained medical doctors carry out FGM https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-019-0817-3  and for other rites, adolescents will always find ways to risky behaviour involving sex, drugs, fights, jumping off heights, driving very fast, and so on.\n\nAs for astronomy and astrology - tell that to all the psychic hotlines, ghost hunter TV shows, Tarot readings and astrology websites that are still up and running even though we have The Hubble Telescope etc.",

If they're declining, that seems consistent with Ellickson's prediction.\"\n\nI meant more (a) when exposed to Science and Progress, cultures don't automatically switch from \"we need to dance to bring rain\" to \"why did we do such stupid things?\", they hold on to customs and traditions and find a way to incorporate them into the new paradigm.  Look at American Hallowe'en, so very different from its origins in Irish and Scottish traditions, which has become so successful it is a global export even to the  countries where it originated and has displaced the traditional version (I doubt any Americans are going down to the river at midnight to draw their shifts against the current to find out who their future husband will be; if they are wearing shifts at all, it's to dress up as Sexy Ghost or Sexy Witch).  Science'n'Progress didn't stop the USA from \"yay, ghosts, spirits and witches! fun!\" because that is how things shake out.\n\nThe 18th century Enlightenment was all about Science'n'Progress, and it was also about the explosion in occult secret societies and Continental Freemasonry.  Granted, astrology as a serious science has gone the way of the dodo, but it's an industry worth around $2 billion and even venture capitalists are putting money into it https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/horoscopes-astrology-industry-venture-capitalists-aquarius-a8886341.html.  It would seem that the pandemic has been a boon for the business:  https://www.businessinsider.com/astrology-industry-boomed-during-pandemic-online-entrepreneurs-2020-12?r=US&IR=T\n\nSo to my eyes, Ellickson seems to have the 19th century high-minded Victorian ideal of education will overcome the darkness of ignorance, as in this quote from a Sherlock Holmes story, \"The Naval Treaty\":\n\n\"It's a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these lines which run high, and allow you to look down upon the houses like this.\"\n\nI thought he was joking, for the view was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself.\n\n\"Look at those big, isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea.\"\n\n\"The board-schools.\"\n\n\"Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wise, better England of the future.\"\n\nI am surprised that he holds such a view, but I don't know enough about him to know if it's due to personal hobbyhorses or what.  I'm dour enough to think that darkness, ignorance, superstition and tradition (in both the good and bad sense) have no problem clinging on to the underbelly of Science'n'Progress.\n\nAs to what is (or was, at the time the book was written) going on in Shasta County, I think it's not that \"ranchers are too dumb to understand the law\", it's that \"the law does not take into account the norms they operate under\".  I think that is what Ellickson is trying to argue on a wider basis?  In Shasta County, the social norms came *first*, before formal laws.  Ranching in California was open range, if I understand correctly; ranching started under Spanish/Mexican governance and boomed with the Gold Rush.  It was after all that was established that public law caught up with it and public governance to oversee the management and use was established; 42% of the rangeland is privately owned so plainly there is going to be tension between \"we were here first and the lawmakers are johnny-come-lately\".  Ranchers established the norms to co-operate and punish defectors, and the traditional-minded/conservative, established ranchers are going to continue on \"this is how we always did it\" rather than abide by the letter of some law dreamed up by city pencil-pushers.  Hence the feeling that, whatever the law technically says, ranchers and cattle were here first and if some city guy speeding on his way to town hits one of their cows, he *should* be liable (the same way he'd be liable if he hit a pedestrian in the city), never mind what the law says about whether there should be fences in place or not.\n\n",

I wish he'd given it more space, but given that he didn't, it might suggest he didn't think too hard about it. Which I absolutely think he should have done. But if I try to fill in what he might have said if he had, I think it would be something like...\n\nWe'd expect these rituals and traditions to phase out, to the extent that they're net harmful. That might look like disappearing entirely, it might look like being replaced with milquetoast versions of them, or in some cases it might just mean they stick around. If the Dani ostensibly cut off fingers to placate angry ghosts, that might be replaced with, I dunno, wrapping nettles around your finger to placate angry ghosts, and later with wrapping benign leaves around your finger to placate angry ghosts. The hypothesis predicts that behaviors would change in the direction of maximizing welfare, but if the beliefs can stay the same while doing so, they might well do.\n\n(Thanks for looking into the Dani btw. It's a plausible idea, and reveals a mistake in my thinking. \"What medical knowledge are they lacking\" assumes the problem is they underestimate the costs, but instead they might overestimate the benefits. I'm not sure if Ellickson made the same mistake: he did use the phrase \"obtain better medical information\", but he used it in the context of puberty rites. Plausibly he meant something like \"better medical information suggesting that puberty will just happen one way or another\".)\n\nI don't know what traditional Halloween looked like, but modern Halloween doesn't seem like something the hypothesis would anti-predict, regardless of whether the \"ghosts and spirits and witches\" angle is something people do for fun or because they actually believe in those things. And modern astrology... I dunno, even if it is seeing a recent boom, it just really does seem like it's a fairly unremarkable thing. Some people do make actual decisions based on it, but it feels like it's \"below the noise threshold\" in some sense.\n\nEllickson gives an example in a footnote:\n\n> Members of the Algonquian tribes in Canada, for example, did discard their religious belief that a slain animal spontaneously regenerates itself after this belief had stimulated over-hunting of valuable forest animals. Various perspectives on this example are discussed in Robert A. Brightman, \"Conservation and Resource Depletion: The Case of the Boreal Forest Algonquians,\" in The Question of the Commons: The Culture and Ecology of Communal Resources 121, 130-133 Bonnie J. McCay and James M. Acheson eds. 1987). The updating of norms is likely to lag, of course, because rational actors are rightly reluctant to abandon long-standing customs.\n\n> As to what is (or was, at the time the book was written) going on in Shasta County, I think it's not that \"ranchers are too dumb to understand the law\", it's that \"the law does not take into account the norms they operate under\". I think that is what Ellickson is trying to argue on a wider basis?\n\nI mostly agree; certainly I don't think Ellickson thinks the ranchers are stupid, and I don't think that either, and if I gave either of those impressions I regret it.\n\nBut I do think the ranchers misunderstand the law, rather than understanding it and deciding they don't care. I mentioned the couple who didn't have enough liability insurance because they thought that in open range, motorists were responsible for not hitting their cows. That could be seen as petty rebellion, I guess. I didn't mention the people who deliberately brought these cases to court where they wouldn't win. That could have been testing the waters to see if the newly appointed judge would go against the law. But between those and various other details, my read of the book is that \"ranchers misunderstand the law\" is the most parsimonious explanation.",

                    "body": "I also need to clarify what I'm trying to say.  I agree that things like \"huh, looks like animals do *not* spontaneously regenerate\" will cause changes in thinking and beliefs.  But I also think that (1) practices, customs and traditions linger on and adapt even after they have been discovered to be non-scientific, and (2) that part of the needs they are addressing aren't covered neatly by Science'n'Progress.\n\n(1) You don't do rain dances any more because you know they don't cause rain.  But you keep doing them because it's a social occasion and it's fun to dress up and dance.  Maybe you do them now because it's a tourist attraction and tourism dollars keep the tribe going through drought periods.  Maybe you do them because you want to keep the new generations in touch with their heritage and roots and you are consciously trying to preserve and hand on cultural practices.\n\n(2)  So rain dances don't help droughts.  Now that Science'n'Progress has told you that, what can you do?  Well, today you have to sit around and wait for the rains to come when and if they will come (or try something like cloud seeding which might work maybe okay probably not but hey you need to try something https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eight-states-are-seeding-clouds-to-overcome-megadrought/).  Back in the old days of superstition, at least having a rain dance gave you back *some* feeling of control, that you *could* do something to influence the weather.  And sometimes it did rain after you did the dance - sure, the dance had nothing to do with it, it was just coincidence, but it helped boost the morale of the community.\n\nAs to ranchers not understanding the law, yes, I think it's more \"misunderstanding\" than anything else.  It probably *feels* more correct that a motorist who hit your cow should pay damages, rather than \"sorry, you are now down $600 on a dead cow and also you may have to pay the motorist for damage to his car\".  And looking at this example of law, I don't know if it holds in Shasta County, but it does look on the face of it that someone might go to court because \"well, the highway wasn't bounded by property like it says here\" and expect not to be held liable:\n\nhttps://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/fencelaw/california.pdf\n\n§ 16902. Livestock on highway; strays; unattended animals\nA person that owns or controls the possession of any livestock shall not willfully or negligently permit any of the livestock to stray upon, or remain unaccompanied by a person in charge or control of the livestock upon, a public highway, if both sides of the highway are adjoined by property which is separated from the highway by a fence, wall, hedge, sidewalk, curb, lawn, or building. \n\n§ 16904. Collision between vehicle and animal; presumption or inference\nIn any civil action which is brought by the owner, driver, or occupant of a motor vehicle, or by their personal representatives or assignees, or by the owner of livestock, for damages which are caused by collision between any motor vehicle and any domestic animal on a highway, there is\nno presumption or inference that the collision was due to negligence on behalf of the owner or the person in possession of the animal. \n\nLaw is best left to the lawyers!\n\n",

            "body": "Okay, having done some Googling, I got information on this from (of all places) a \"Daily Mail\" article:\n\n\"As well as their quite liberal view towards clothing, the tribe are also well known for their unique practice of self mutilation.\n\nAfter the passing of a loved one, relatives are expected to cut off the top part of their fingers as a sign of respect and grieving.\n\nThe practice is meant to symbolise the pain one feels after losing a loved one with many people in the tribe often amputating multiple fingers during their lifetime. \"\n\nIt's only women who are expected to do this, and it has been outlawed by the Indonesian government so it's the old women of the tribe who show marks of this.  The Peabody Museum has a very short piece including this:\n\n\"Indeed, warfare dominated much of life. Its causes were complex and varied, including the ritual pacification of ghosts and revenge for previous deaths incurred in battle.  ...A death, by enemy action in ambush or battle, was considered particularly dangerous for the community, and elaborate funerals were staged to placate the ghosts of an alliance's dead.\"\n\nSo yeah, I think that cutting off a fingertip is meant to be apotropaic, to placate angry ghosts and evil spirits.  Animist cultures don't have a very benign view of the dead and tend to live in constant dread of the influence of the spirits who are very easy to offend or to break taboos.  A culture built around low-level but constant skirmishing, which can erupt into serious violence, is going to have an elevated risk of male death and the concomitant necessity for female family members to placate angry ghosts by symbolic sacrifice  to offset the loss of life (cut off a finger tip instead of burning a widow).",

The only way to do global tracking would involve either getting access to SOSUS (good luck with that) or building a private alternative (way too expensive, also likely to make navies nervous).  You're correct about my claims on the traditional method.  Fishing vessels were a major capital item, so their owners would have been chasing reasonably reliable returns, which you don't generally get from truly nomadic fish.

Given what I know of the ocean's food distribution pattern, you're not going to have much biomass doing that because food appears in specific areas at specific times.)  \n\nI'm skeptical that property rights in fisheries could be made to work given the legal regime that currently governs the world's oceans.  https://www.navalgazing.net/Territorial-and-International-Waters",

    "body": "\"Or, what about dueling traditions? We might again say the “workaday” assumption (that brings rules against murder) is violated, but that seems like a cheat. My vague understanding, at least of pistol dueling as seen in Hamilton, is it was less lethal than we might expect; and fell out of favor when better guns made it more lethal. But neither of these feels enough to satisfy, and we should demand satisfaction. Did the group gain something that was worth the potential loss of life?\"\n\nLeaving aside the \"non-lethal\" part and aiming straight at duels to the death - yes, there is a social benefit to having the accepted means of resolving (serious) disputes be a duel to the death, primarily based around social unity.\n\n1) A duel to the death doesn't leave an aggrieved party who might want to relitigate matters. There's a winner (who isn't aggrieved) and a loser (who is dead).\n\n2) In particular, in reasonably-small societies where individual charismatic politicians are a big deal, this tends to defang rabble-rousers and cut down on civil strife. A would-be revolutionary is going to wind up getting challenged to a duel at some point (or will themselves challenge existing leaders), which can end in three ways: a) they win, and are now in charge, b) they lose, and are dead, c) they repeatedly refuse to fight, lose credibility, and can't mount any kind of insurrection or resistance. All of those horns will generally avoid ongoing strife.\n\nIt should also be noted that duelling has mostly involved men, and not women. On societal timescales, men are quite expendable - losing 10% of your women loses 10% of the next generation, but this is not true of men.",

At all times, you have a balance of trade with the other party. Either you've done more for them than they have for you, and your balance is negative, or they've done more for you than you have for them, and your balance is positive. But that balance can never be zero; it's a real number.\n\nSo instead of expecting an unachievable balance, the expectation is that the balance shouldn't be too far from zero in either direction. If you think it's too far toward you, you fix that by asking for a favor. If that doesn't work, you complain to your friends.\n\nAnd at this point, it doesn't matter whether both parties agree on what the balance is! Even if I think you owe me a minor favor and you think I owe you one, that is fine - eventually someone will ask for a favor, and the balance will shift in their direction. No problems arise unless several recent favors all have sharply asymmetric valuations, such that each party's estimation of the overall balance is wildly different from the other's.",

To the heart of the concept is community unity through cooperative work and mutually reciprocal support.\"\n\nIt also makes for social controls and sanctions: if you offend against the norms, or piss off enough of your neighbours, they will boycott or shun you.  Then you have to try and hire in external labourers to work in bringing in the harvest, which you may not have the money to do so, or which will severely cost you even if you manage it, and connections are broken until they are repaired or until the offender is driven out.",

In the immortal words of not only Shakespeare but also Neal Peart, “all the world’s indeed a stage/and we are merely players/performers and portrayers.” Dishonesty is (imho) an unavoidable side effect of this multiple-masks aspect of human nature. So societies say “don’t lie” but what they mean is “lie about only certain things in certain ways.” Deciding what the acceptable lies are in any given social context is sort of illuminating. Hence the bafflement of some serial philanderers; that territory used to be a safe lie. ",

It didn't help that I had no idea what the subject and thesis of the book were until the middle of the review. Only at the very end did the practical relevance of Ellickson's thesis really click for me. The reviewer engages with Ellickson in a technical, nuts-and-bolts kind of way that I found unhelpful and a bit tedious, mostly due to my unfamiliarity.

The sort where corporations have millions (or billions) at stake, or where you want to ensure that nobody screws up and kills a bunch of people. For all the smaller issues in the world, the time-honored rule of \"Don't be a dick\" is the true law. And it's mostly for the best. ",

        "body": "I agree, but I'm tentatively okay with it.  It would mess with the flow of the review if they had to either remove these references to the ideas, or else use weasel words to pretend that these were links to someone else's work.  Additionally, I have no idea who this person is even after clicking the links, so I don't feel compromised in any way, though I am not especially deep in the broader community here and probably wouldn't recognize most peoples' home pages.  And I'd expect that people who do know the author well would probably be able to figure it from the essay alone based on the writing style and the way they think.\n\nThe only people this will affect are people who:\n-Are going to vote in the contest\n-Know the author well enough that knowing their identity could affect their vote\n-But wasn't able to recognize the person based on their writing style\n-Click the link\n-Recognize who the person is based on their home page\n-Weren't already going to vote for/against the author anyway (ie, someone who dislikes a person and their writing style won't be meaningfully biased against them since they weren't going to vote for them anyway)\n\nThis is probably a very small set of people, though I suppose it's somewhat larger if you restrict to the set of all people who are going to vote, a small percentage of votes swinging one way or another will matter.  However, anyone who has genuine concerns about compromising their own vote can deliberately avoid clicking the links to the author's home page.\n\nI think there is a real cost here in the imprecise anonymity, but I think there is a tradeoff in that allowing it creates a slightly better review, and years from now this review will still exist in the archives and the contest will long be over, so in my eyes it's worth it.

I don't think chicken turning out to be conscious is highly likely, but with how little we still understand of consciousness, I have a very hard time putting the chance of it below p=0.2 or thereabouts.
