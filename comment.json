It's still an improvement,  it just didn't solve the problem all the way. :)\n\nLooking at the source code, the problem is that the links point to anchors that don't exist.  So e.g., footnote 2 links to an anchor \"fn:replant\", and the link back from footnote 2 links to an an anchor \"fnref:replant\", but there are no such anchors, so they don't work.  So, if you want this to work, you'll have to add the appropriate anchors.  So e.g., the footnote 2 link should, in addition to href=\"...\", also have name=\"fnref:replant\".  And at the beginning of foonote 2 there should be an 'a' tag with name=\"fn:replant\".\n\nI do notice you changed the anchor links from absolute on slatestarcodex.com, to absolute on the correct page; that will work, once you add the names, but I would still encourage you to use relative anchor links as described above -- where you only include the anchor (including the number sign), not the rest of the URL -- so that they will still work if this is posted elsewhere, as general good practice.",

Generate the HTML (simple, has only basic tags, no reliance on CSS)\n2. Open in browser, Ctrl+A, copy (I said copy-paste above, I meant copy)\n3. Paste in substack\n\nSubstack seems to ingest it just fine, recognizes tags like <blockquote>, seems to handle our images pretty well, etc. \n\nSo if anyone submitted book reviews to you in a plain-jane HTML format, my advice is to copy it from a browser and paste THAT directly into substack and see how it looks; if they're not relying on any weird CSS and it's just structured text with basic tags chances are it should work. If it has simply formatted anchor tags for footnotes, in theory those should work too!",
